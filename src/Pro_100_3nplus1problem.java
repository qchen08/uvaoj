// Definition of The 3n+1 problem:
// The 3n+1 problem is as follows: consider a positive number n. 
// The cycle length of n is the number of times we repeat the following, 
// until we reach n=1:
// 			If n is odd, then n ⇐ 3n+1
//			If n is even, then n ⇐ n/2

// For example, given n=22, we see the following sequence: 
// 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1. 
// The cycle length of 22 is, therefore, 16, since it took 
// 16 repetitions to get to 1.
// Given a definition of cycle length of a number, here’s the 
// rest of the problem: given any two numbers i and j, compute 
// the maximum cycle length over all numbers between i and j, inclusive.
